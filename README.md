# A backend for Perceval to retrieve Taiga's data
A grimoirelab-perceval backend for the API of a Taiga service [1] that extracts information about the projects hosted in such service.
It was born as a self-standing tool, but has been extended as a basic backend of grimoirelab-perceval [2], the data collector of CHAOSS GrimoireLab Tool.
