# Testing
This doc is about testing Perceval's backend for Taiga API.

## Organization
Using unittest's terminology, **test_taiga.py** has its tests organized in following TestCases:
- TestTaigaCommand
- TestTaigaBackend
- TestTaigaClientAgainstRealServer (this one is disabled by default)
- TestTaigaClientAgainstMockServer
- TestsUnderConstruction (disabled draft testcases)
- Utilities (disabled by default)

## Basic regression Testing
As its name states, _TestTaigaClientAgainstMockServer_ mocks the Taiga server. As stated in Perceval's [README.md](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval) we use _httpretty_ for that, and expect it to be preinstalled. If you have pip installed (docker image grimoirelab/full has it) you can install httpretty with

`$ sudo pip install httpretty`

You should get something like this:

## Unit testing and test development

### Running isolated TestCases
While developing it is a good practice to separate the stable tests from the ones being developed, so there's a TestCase named _TestsUnderConstruction_ for that. You can run that TestCase alone as follows:

`$ ./test_taiga.py TestsUnderConstruction`

### Utilities
You'll probably want to mock other API responses. Among the _Utilities_ class _test_capture_, in combination with _capture_*_ methods helps you to capture series of responses (Taiga API returns paginated results).
This class isn't really meant as a pure TestCase but as a collector of utilities. However, it contains tests for these utilities, so it indeed plays the TestCase role.


## Full regression Testing
All tests against a real server are skipped by default  to avoid annoying the real Taiga service. In order to run them you need to comment out the _@unittest.skip_ decorator in line 249 and get a valid API token for your Taiga instance and edit the **test_taiga.cfg** file to feed it at the _Token_ entry (at line 11).

```
# Testing data
# 

[taiga-site]
API_URL = https://api.taiga.io/api/v1/

[taiga-default-credentials]
User     = ledamc-izubiaurre
Password = xxxcensoredxxx

Token    = xxxcensoredxxx

[test-data]
```

The tests against a real server are configured to call [Taiga,io](https://taiga.io) service. If you have an own Taiga instance you also need to adapt the _API_URL_ entry (at line 5) accordingly.

And there's at least two tests that get a token from Taiga's API with a set of valid credentials. If you want to run them, you also need to adapt the _User_ and _Password_ entries a (at lines 8 and 9) to feed the valid credentials.


Specific test data and expected results are provided in the same **test_taiga.cfg** file. They might have become obsolete since they were captured and you use them again. You should re-baseline them in your first runs.
